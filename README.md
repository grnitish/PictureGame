# PictureGame


This project is an extension of: Coding Nepal Web Word Guessing Game. We improved and modified the code to display images and developed the game to fit our project needs and requirements. We did this project as part of our coursework for Foundations of Software Engineering under the guidance of Professor Paige Rodeghero.
